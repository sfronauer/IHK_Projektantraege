## üß© About

It simplifies the process of writing and formatting project applications according to IHK guidelines.

**This is a team project developed by three trainees during our vocational training.
We collaborated on design, development, and documentation**

Frontend was made by: [Mark Rotaru](https://github.com/rotarumark) and me

The goal is to make it easier for trainees to structure their ideas and generate clean, consistent proposal drafts.
